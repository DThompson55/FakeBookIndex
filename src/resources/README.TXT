This CD contains the entire contents of twelve of the most popular jazz fake books in the USA.  All of the fake books are presented in Adobe Acrobat 4.0 PDF format.  In order to view or print any of the material, the Adobe Acrobat 4.0 Reader program must be installed on your computer.  For computers with the Windows 95/98 operating systems, the Adobe Acrobat Reader program is contained on this CD.  To install, simply select MY COMPUTER and then select the drive letter of you CD player.  Look for the icon labeled AR40ENG.  Click on this icon and follow the instructions for installation.  For Apple Macintosh owners, the Mac Adobe Acrobat 4.0 reader can be downloaded free from the Adobe web site.  The URL for the site is  http://www.adobe.com 
 
This CD should automatically load both the Adobe Acrobat 4.0 Reader and the fakebook PDF files on Win 95/98 machines.  To view the contents of this CD, simply use your mouse to click on the name of the Master Index or the fakebook name.  The logical place to start is the Master Index. Scroll down to the name of the song you are looking for, or use FIND to find it for you.  Once found, write down the name of the book and the page number.  There is no facility to go directly from the Master Index to the fakebook page.  To return to the MENU, select DOCUMENT, and GO BACK DOC.  From the MENU page, select the book name with your mouse and click.  That's all there is to it.

If you are not familiar with the many features of Acrobat, select HELP from the right side of the toolbar and then select Guide.
  
Macintosh machines will not autoload, but all other features available on Win 95/98 machines should also be available to the Mac.  

What if the CD does not autoload?
Once Acrobat is installed, execute the program by selecting START, PROGRAM, ADOBE ACROBAT.  Once Acrobat has loaded, press FILES on the top left of screen.  Select OPEN and then select the CD Drive letter.  Although you may select any of the fakebooks files here, the best way is to select MENU.PDF.  This is the selection menu.  Opening the Master Index or any of the fakebook files is simply a matter of point and click on the name of the desired file.  You should always return to the selection menu after viewing.  The can be done by selecting DOCUMENT on the top of the Acrobat screen.  Then select GO BACK DOC.  See Adobe Acrobat documentation for additional tips.  

Many of these fake books (Including all of the New Real Books) were originally printed on extra large size paper.  To print on standard size paper, be sure to select the Fit to Page option on the Acrobat  print option screen.
