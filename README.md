# FakeBookIndex
I wanted a way to find songs across all of my fake books. And while I cannot add copyrighted materials to this repo directly, most of these books can be found on the internets. This index includes the following books, painstakingly scraped and curated.

- ColoBk, "The Colorado Cookbook"
- EvansBk, "Bill Evans Fakebook"
- JazzFake, "Jazz Fake Book"
- JazzLTD, "Jazz LTD"
- Library, "Library of Musicians Jazz"
- NewReal1, "The New Real Book"
- NewReal2, "The New Real Book Volume 2"
- NewReal3, "The New Real Book Volume 3"
- RealBk1, "The Real Book 5th Edition"
- RealBk2, "The Real Book 5th Edition, Volume 2"
- RealBk3, The Real Book 5th Edition, Volume 3"
- CubanBk1, "The Cuban Fake Book Volume 1"

Place your copies of these books in the resources folder, names all uppercase (for now). For example, COLOBK.PDF for the Colorado Cookbook.

After you install everything, run from the terminal window, npm run start.

I might do a more finished version 2, but this is all I need for now.
